Class Project

Created a program in C which takes a 24-bit bitmap image specified by the user and produces five altered versions of the image as files, with the alterations being: 
    - grayscale, 
    - inverted color, 
    - increased contrast, 
    - resized and duplicated with separate color channels, 
    - and flipped vertically and mirrored horizontally.

Test images to use, provided in folder, were given by the instructor.

Input requirements: 
    1. Files located in same folder as program.
    2. File name entered by user does not include extension.
    3. Image size entered by user is in the form "width height", in pixels, and is the true size.
